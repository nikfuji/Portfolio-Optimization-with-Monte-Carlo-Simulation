This project uses Monte Carlo simulations on 5 years of historical stock data to find optimal portfolio allocations. It calculates returns, risk, and Sharpe ratio for thousands of random portfolios, and identifies:

Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio (best risk-adjusted return)

Min Volatility Portfolio (lowest risk)

Key visualizations include:

Correlation heatmap of stocks

Box plot of log returns

Efficient Frontier (Risk vs Return) with optimal portfolios highlighted

Built with Python, pandas, numpy, yfinance, and interactive Plotly plots.
